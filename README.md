# Contact Management Application 
<!-- endhide -->

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router, and Context.API.

Hello! It is time to start doing professional front-end applications. This time
we will be creating a small contact management application that allows users to:
Read, Create, Update and Delete contacts. 

You may use this gif: [Check it out here!](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-contact-list/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

## 🌱 How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we will be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react boilerplate` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```

**👉 Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

> 💡 Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

1. Install the `/node_modules`
   
```bash
$ npm install
```

2. Run the development server

```bash
$ npm run start
```

***Please Use the Context for This Project:** The template comes with the Context.API already configured.

## 📝 Instructions:

- You must add the necessary code to ensure your application handles contacts through the typical CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), specifically:
    - Create
    - Read contacts
    - Update
    - Delete
- (Optional) Ask the user for confirmation before deleting a contact. We recommend wsing a Modal component for this.

All functionalities must be implemented under the concept of Context.API.

`fetch` the data from the API: [https://playground.4geeks.com/contact/docs](https://playground.4geeks.com/contact/docs)

## The Project Should Have Two Different Views:

1. **Contact:** This view should display the list of contacts.
2. **AddContact:** This view should include the form used to create or update contacts.

### One Component:

1. **ContactCard:** Displays a single contact.

## 💡 Tips:

+ Use Postman to test the API endpoints before coding.

That is it! Start coding your React Application :)
